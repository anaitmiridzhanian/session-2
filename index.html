        <p><strong>[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]</strong><br>
        Every second, every minute <br>
        Man, I swear that she can get it <br>
        Say if you a bad bitch, put your hands up high <br>
        Hands up high, hands up high <br>
        Tell 'em dim the lights down right now <br>
        Put me in the mood <br>
        I'm talkin' about dark room, perfume, go, go</p>

        <p>[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]<br>
        I recognize your fragrance<br>
        Hold up, you ain't never gotta say shit<br>
        Uh, and I know your taste is<br>
        A little bit, hmm, high maintenance<br>
        Uh, everybody else basic<br>
        You live life on an everyday basis<br>
        With poetic justice, poetic justice<br>
        If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room<br>
        Would you trust it?<br>
        I mean, I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when<br>
        You're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen<br>
        Better yet, where your friends and 'em?<br>
        I really wanna know you all<br>
        I really wanna show you off<br>
        Fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne<br>
        Cold nights when you curse this name<br>
        You called up your girlfriends<br>
        And y'all curled in that little bitty Range<br>
        I heard that she wanna go and party, she wanna go and party<br>
        Nigga, don't approach her with that Atari<br>
        Nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry<br>
        They say conversation rule a nation, I can tell<br>
        But I could never right my wrongs<br>
        'Less I write it down for real, P.S.</p>

<p>[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]<br>
You can get it, you can get it<br>
You can get it, you can get it<br>
And I know just, know just, know just<br>
Know just, know just what you want<br>
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright<br>
You can get it, you can get it<br>
You can get it, you can get it<br>
And I know just, know just, know just<br>
Know just, know just what you want<br>
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright</p>

<p>[Verse 2: Drake]<br>
I really hope you play this, 'cause ol' girl, you test my patience<br>
With all these seductive photographs<br>
And all these one-off vacations you've been takin'<br>
Clearly a lot for me to take in, it don't make sense<br>
Young East African girl, you too busy fuckin' with your other man<br>
I was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane<br>
Take you and your momma to the motherland<br>
I could do it, maybe one day<br>
When you figure out you're gonna need someone<br>
When you figure out it's alright here in the city<br>
And you don't run from where we come from<br>
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice<br>
You were so new to this life, but goddamn, you got adjusted<br>
I mean, I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex<br>
Your natural hair and your soft skin<br>
And your big ass in that sundress, ooh<br>
Good God, what you doin' that walk for?<br>
When I see that thing move<br>
I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more<br>
They say communication save relations, I can tell<br>
But I can never right my wrongs<br>
Unless I write 'em down for real, P.S.</p>

<p>[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]<br>
You can get it, you can get it<br>
You can get it, you can get it<br>
And I know just, know just, know just<br>
Know just, know just what you want<br>
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright<br>
You can get it, you can get it<br>
You can get it, you can get it<br>
And I know just, know just, know just<br>
Know just, know just what you want<br>
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright</p>

<p>[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]<br>
Every time I write these words they become a taboo<br>
Makin' sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true<br>
Livin' my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof<br>
I'm talkin' poetic justice, poetic justice<br>
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room<br>
Would you trust it? I mean, you need to hear this<br>
Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' in the mirror<br>
Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' for it, maybe<br>
Call me crazy, we can both be insane<br>
A fatal attraction is common, and what we have common is pain<br>
I mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb<br>
And I can see power steerin', sex drive when you swerve<br>
I want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it<br>
Uh-huh, that's your heartbeat<br>
It either caught me or it called me, uh-huh<br>
Read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines<br>
Sincerely, yours truly, and right before you go blind, P.S.</p>

<p>[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]<br>
You can get it, you can get it<br>
You can get it, you can get it<br>
And I know just, know just, know just<br>
Know just, know just what you want<br>
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright<br>
You can get it, you can get it<br>
You can get it, you can get it<br>
And I know just, know just, know just<br>
Know just, know just what you want<br>
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright</p>

<p>[Outro Skit]<br>
"I'm gon' ask you one more time, homie<br>
Where is you from? Or it is a problem."<br>
"Ayy, you over here for Sherane, homie?"<br>
"Yo, I don't care who this nigga over here for.<br>
If he don't tell me where he from, it's a wrap! I'm sorry."<br>
"Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, we gon' do it like this, okay?<br>
I'ma tell you where I'm from, okay?<br>
You gon' tell me where you from, okay?<br>
Or where your grandma stay, where your mama stay, or where your daddy stay, okay?"<br>
"Enough with all this talkin'."<br>
"Matter of fact, get out the van, homie! Get out the car before I snatch you out that motherfucker, homie!"
